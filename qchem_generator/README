QChem Generator
============
Rick Muller <rmuller@sandia.gov>

The QChem Generator is a branch of the PyQuante Project that creates C
programs out of PyQuante molecules. Currently the code is very simple.

The code is driven by the Python script make_hf_driver.py. There are
several test programs in that module that show how a PyQuante Molecule
object can be used to generate a main.c program. This program can be
compiled and linked with cints.c, a modification of the PyQuante
integral code, and qc.c, a set of helper functions, to produce a
simple Hartree-Fock program.

Currently the program only needs the LAPACK routine dsygv.
