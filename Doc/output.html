<h1 id="pyquante-pythonquantumchemistry">PyQuante - Python Quantum Chemistry</h1>

<p><a href="mailto:rmuller@sandia.gov">Rick Muller</a> v1.5.0</p>

<h2 id="whatispyquante">What is PyQuante?</h2>

<p><a href="http://pyquante.sourceforge.net/">PyQuante</a> 
(<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/pyquante">Download Site</a>
<a href="userguide.html">User Guide</a>) 
is an open-source suite of programs
for developing quantum chemistry methods. The program is written in
the <a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a> programming language, but has many
&#8220;rate-determining&#8221; modules also written in C for speed. The resulting
code is not nearly as fast as
<a href="http://www.schrodinger.com/Products/jaguar.html">Jaguar</a>,
<a href="http://www.emsl.pnl.gov/docs/nwchem/nwchem.html">NWChem</a>,
<a href="http://www.gaussian.com/">Gaussian</a>, or
<a href="http://www.msg.ameslab.gov/GAMESS/GAMESS.html">GAMESS</a>, but the
resulting code is much easier to understand and modify. </p>

<p>The goal of
this software is not necessarily to provide a working quantum
chemistry program (although it will hopefully do that), but rather to
provide a well-engineered set of tools so that scientists can
construct their own quantum chemistry programs without going through
the tedium of having to write every low-level routine. More
information, including links to the download page, is available at
<a href="http://pyquante.sourceforge.net">the PyQuante Home Page</a>. </p>

<p>Here is an example of what closed-shell Hartree-Fock scripts look
like:</p>

<pre><code>def rhf(atoms,**opts):
    "General wrapper for restricted closed-shell hartree fock"
    ConvCriteria = opts.get('ConvCriteria',1e-5)
    MaxIter = opts.get('MaxIter',20)
    basis = opts.get('basis',None)
    bfs = getbasis(atoms,basis)
    S,h,Ints = getints(bfs,atoms)
    orbs = get_guess(h,S)
    nel = atoms.get_nel()
    enuke = atoms.get_enuke()
    nclosed,nopen = divmod(nel,2)
    eold = 0.
    for i in range(MaxIter):
        D = mkdens(evecs,0,nocc)
        G = get2JmK(Ints,D)
        F = h+G
        evals,evecs = GHeigenvectors(F,S)
        energy = get_energy(h,F,D,enuke)
        print energy
        if abs(energy-eold) &lt; ConvCriteria: break
        eold = energy
    return energy
</code></pre>

<p>Even without knowing any Python, it is easy to see what the various 
steps in the program are doing.</p>

<h2 id="programmingphilosophy">Programming Philosophy</h2>

<p>I always strive for simplicity over speed. Data structures change more
often than functions. My aim here is to be more rigid about functional
interfaces than data interfaces. Which means that I only program
functions in C, not data structures themselves, which I keep in python
so I can change them as the needs of the code evolve. I believe that
the first mistake people make in object-oriented programming is to
make a very rigid object structure that cannot evolve with the code.</p>

<p>Currently the only C routines are the integral code and the NumPy
routines. This may change out of necessity if there appear to be huge
bottlenecks keeping some of this in python, but I&#8217;d rather keep as
much code in python and only put routines in C if I really, really
need to.</p>

<h2 id="license">License</h2>

<p>The software is released under the modified BSD license, which means
that everyone is free to download, use, and modify the code without
charge.</p>

<h2 id="obtainingthecode">Obtaining the Code</h2>

<p>The program is available in tarball form from the 
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/pyquante">PyQuante Download Page</a>. The CVS archive for the program is also at Sourceforge, and is recommended for anyone wanting to stay on the bleeding edge; information on how to access the CVS archive is available <a href="http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=43213">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="buildingthecode">Building the Code</h2>

<p>Much of the code is written in python, and thus is platform
independent. The rest of the code now uses the python distutils
procedures for building the C modules. Type</p>

<pre><code>% sudo python setup.py install
</code></pre>

<p>and the code should build and install properly. I&#8217;ve tested this on
Linux, Windows/Cygwin, and Macintosh OS X.</p>

<h2 id="gettingstarted">Getting Started</h2>

<p>There is a <a href="userguide.html">User Guide</a> and other documentation in
the Doc subdirectory, and tests in the Tests subdirectory.
Subscription to the
<a href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/pyquante-users">mailing list</a> is highly recommended for further support. <a href="mailto:rmuller@sandia.gov">Email me</a> if you need additional help.</p>
