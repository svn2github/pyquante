PyQuante: Python Quantum Chemistry
 PyQuante is a toolkit for building quantum chemistry programs in the
 Python programming language.

 Modules:
 CGBF         Class/functions for manipulating contracted Gaussian bfns
 PGBF         Class/functions for manipulating primitive Gaussian bfns
 hartree_fock Functions for simple closed-shell Hartree-Fock calculations
 LA2          Add-ons to the LinearAlgebra package
 pyints       Basic one- and two-electron integrals written in python
 cints        C version of the functions in pyints
 rys          Two-electron integrals using Rys quadrature
 crys         C version of the functions in rys
 hgp          Two-electron ints using Head-Gordon/Pople recursion relations
 chgp         C version of the functions in hgp
 basis_*      Different basis sets
 dft          Module for closed-shell LDA density functional theory
 DFunctionals Different density functionals (right now only S & VWN)

 This program is part of the PyQuante quantum chemistry program suite.
